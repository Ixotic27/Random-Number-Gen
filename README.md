# Random-Number-Gen
This repository contains my first C project, a simple random number generator. It serves as a foundational step in my journey to mastering C programming and exploring the world of algorithms. This project demonstrates basic concepts in C, such as loops, conditionals, and the use of the rand() function to generate random numbers.
